# Convolutional-Neural-Network
This is a 3 layers Convolutional Neural Network. It has two convolution layers and one fully connected layer. The structure of the network as be shown as the following.
Data -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Max-pooling -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Max-pooling -> Dropout -> Dense -> ReLU -> Dense -> Softmax
